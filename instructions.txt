Language: Python 3.6.5, Shell (optional) 

The user needs to create a virtual environment first.
  
  virtualenv env

I have added a shell script which will automatically run the virtual environment
and execute the python script. 

The user will only need to grant permissions to run the shell script. If
a shell is not available, the user can manually run the following:

  source env/bin/activate
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  python solution.py
  deactivate

I hope that you like my solution. Many thanks!
