Language: Python 3.6.5, Shell (optional) 

I have added a shell script which will automatically run the virtual environment
and execute the python script. 

The user will only need to grant permissions to run the shell script. 

Otherwise, the user can manually do the following:

  virtualenv env
  source env/bin/activate
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  python solution.py
  deactivate

I hope that you like my solution. Many thanks!
